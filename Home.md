Welcome to the coding-standards wiki!

Welcome!

## Overview
This is a collection of **best practices** intended to be useful for career programmers and independent freelancers. There is a focus here on C#, but some concepts, such as "A function does one thing" (from Uncle Bob's _Clean Code_) can translate to a hundred different languages.

Having worked on several different projects with several different teams, there are certain practices that can be identified. The goal here will not be to water down to the lowest common denominator, but to steer towards a level of cleanliness that encourages innovation and facilitates maintenance and readability. It is acknowledged that some people have different preferences, say, on the naming of private members. But there are broader issues which can impact your ability to collaborate with others in a big way. It is practically a crime to leave your code in such a level of disarray under the assumption that you'll either clean it up later or always be the only one dealing with it--as when another developer has to patch in an enhancement or find a bug could spend so much time trying to unravel it or read it that they might as well have started over from scratch. That is something all developers should try to avoid. No developer is an island. Your code should reflect an understanding of that.
