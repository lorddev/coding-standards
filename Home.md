Welcome to the coding-standards wiki!

We will start with the [Overview](https://github.com/A-frame/coding-standards/wiki/Overview) (which should probably be moved over to this page).

You can either fork or issue pull requests, even cloning the wiki git url and editing with your favorite Markdown editor.
