Coding Standards
================

This is an open-source collaborative coding standards wiki with a slight emphasis on C# as it is affected by ~~StyleCop~~ + Resharper.

The entire project consits of *Markdown* files using GitHub's built-in Wiki format. Files are periodically merged from the wiki repository into the project's master branch, to take advantage of graph features, but it is intended for use as a GitHub Wiki, so please navigate to the [Wiki](https://github.com/lorddev/coding-standards/wiki) tab for the content and [repository URL](https://github.com/lorddev/coding-standards.wiki.git).

### Note
To help search engines find our repo I'm just going to randomly shout "style guides" and "design guidelines". Thanks...
