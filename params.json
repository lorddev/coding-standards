{"google":"UA-2256629-4","body":"### Welcome to the Coding Standards Wiki\r\n\r\n**CSW** is a collection of **best practices** intended to be useful for career programmers and independent freelancers. There is a focus here on C#, but some concepts, such as \"A function should do one thing\" (from _Clean Code_'s [Bob Martin](http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/09/11/one-thing-extract-till-you-drop)) can translate to a hundred different programming languages.\r\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I'm the kind of developer who always wants to get better. Whenever I find ways to improve my process or make my code cleaner, I try to implement that knowledge right away. Having worked on several different projects with several different teams, there are certain best practices that can be identified that would apply to all sorts of projects. The goal here will not be to water down to the lowest common denominator, but to steer towards a level of cleanliness that encourages innovation and facilitates maintenance and readability.\r\n\r\n## Your Participation Is Requested!\r\n\r\nThe built-in Markdown compatibility and Git versioning make GitHub an ideal place for such a project, as well as the wide adoption of GitHub itself by open-source programmers. If you search for \"coding standards\" on GitHub, there are only a few repositories, and they are pretty much project-specific, so it's a wide-open \"market\" of sorts.\r\n\r\nMake your voice heard! This is your chance to promote universal action regarding your favorite pet peeve! Maybe we can start something here and have the kind of effect that would help educate people around the world and reduce the frequency of messy spaghetti code we'll encounter in the future!\r\n\r\nYou can fork or issue pull requests, even cloning the [Wiki repository](https://github.com/A-frame/coding-standards.wiki.git) and editing with your favorite Markdown editor. If you don't feel like doing all that, feel free to just create an issue with your suggestions. We look forward to hearing from you!","note":"Don't delete this file!

{"google":"UA-2256629-4","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","note":"Don't delete this file!
